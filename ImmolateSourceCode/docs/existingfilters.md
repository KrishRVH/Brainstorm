# Existing Filters

In-depth explanations and usage guides are in the comments of each filter file.

- **Analyzer:** Prints a full analysis of a seed.
	- To run this, the following syntax is recommended: `immolate -f analyzer -s THESEED -n 1 -g 1`
	- It's also recommended to customize the filter itself to your needs. (deck, stake, maximum ante to search, number of cards per ante)
- **Bad Seeds:** Seeds with very little rare or uncommon jokers in Antes 1-4.
	- This filter was designed to generate seeds that are difficult to beat, but it doesn't do a good job at that.
- **Buggy Erratic:** Searches for seeds with glitched erratic decks. These seeds would generate a deck with only 10s of Spades if playing with Erratic Deck.
- **Buggy Seeds**: Searches for glitched seeds. These seeds would freeze the game when trying to use them.
- **Cavendish:** Searches for a seed where Cavendish can be obtained after Round 2. Both it and Gros Michel may appear in the shop or in a buffoon pack. Gros Michel must be bought after Round 1, and it will go extinct immediately.
- **Double Legendary:** Searches for a seed with two legendary jokers in Ante 1. Every Arcana or Spectral Pack in the shop must be opened.
- **Emperor Fool:** Searches for Emperor-Fool Chains.
	- Score output is the length of the chain, with the last digit being the ante that The Emperor must be used in to start the chain.
- **Erratic Flush Five:** Searches for an Erratic Deck seed with lots of an exact card.
	- Score output is the number of card matches. Increase the cutoff score to raise the minimum number of cards.

- **Four Deadly Jokers:** Searches for a first shop buffoon pack with the four jokers that give increased mult to suits.
- **High Score Demo:** Searches for a seed with a good setup for high score world record runs.
	- Because this filter was written during Balatro's demo, its search criteria is far from optimal for the current world record strategy.

- **Longest Joker Name:** Searches for seeds with a Polychrome Perishable Rental Delayed Gratification in the first shop.

- **Orbital Test:** A filter to test the capability of searching Orbital Tag output, which is currently WIP.
- **Perkeo Analyzer:** Prints all consumable generator queues of a seed (Seals, Judgement, Wraith, etc.)
	- The name has nothing to do with the joker Perkeo.

	- If the score is at least 901, Judgement gives either a Bull, Green Joker, or Raised Fist.
	- Because this filter was written during Balatro's demo, its search criteria is far from optimal for the full version.

	- For successful seeds, the score is the predicted amount of cash obtained at the end of the run.
- **Straight Flushes:** Checks if the first two blinds of Ante 1 deal straight flushes immediately
