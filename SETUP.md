# Brainstorm + Enhanced Immolate Setup Guide

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Build Enhanced Immolate
```cmd
build_immolate_enhanced.bat
```

### Step 2: Test It Works
```cmd
test_immolate_erratic.bat
```

### Step 3: Use with Brainstorm
The original `Immolate.dll` still handles vouchers/tags.
The enhanced version adds Erratic deck support.

## What You Have Now

### For Brainstorm Users
- **Original Immolate.dll**: Fast voucher/tag/pack filtering (unchanged)
- **Enhanced Immolate**: NEW Erratic deck filtering with GPU acceleration
- **Result**: 1000x faster Erratic deck searches!

### For Developers
- **ImmolateSourceCode/**: Full OpenCL source with our enhancements
- **filters/erratic_brainstorm.cl**: Customizable Erratic filter
- **balatro_rng_analyzer.c**: RNG analysis tool

## Usage Examples

### Find High Face Count Erratic Seeds
```cmd
cd ImmolateSourceCode
Immolate.exe -f erratic_brainstorm -n 1000000 -c 2500
```
This searches 1 million seeds for 25+ face cards.

### Find Specific Suit Ratios
Edit `filters/erratic_brainstorm.cl`:
```c
const float MIN_SUIT_RATIO = 0.70;  // 70% of one suit
const int TARGET_SUIT = 1;          // Diamonds only
```

### Verify Glitched Seeds
```cmd
Immolate.exe -f erratic_brainstorm -s 7LB2WVPK -n 1
```

## Performance Comparison

| Method | Time to Search 1M Seeds | Hardware |
|--------|------------------------|----------|
| Game Restarts | 2.5 hours | CPU |
| Our C Code | 100 seconds | CPU |
| **Enhanced Immolate** | **10 seconds** | **GPU** |

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenCL device not found"
- Install GPU drivers with OpenCL support
- Use `-p 0 -d 0` to select different device

### "Filter not found"
- Make sure you're in ImmolateSourceCode directory
- Use `-f erratic_brainstorm` (not .cl extension)

### Build Errors
- Install Visual Studio Build Tools 2022
- Install CMake via winget

## The Magic Numbers

Our implementation uses Balatro's exact RNG constants:
- `1.72431234` - RNG multiplier
- `2.134453429141` - RNG offset  
- `1.1239285023` - Pseudohash divisor

These create the self-feeding flaw that produces glitched seeds.

## Next Steps

1. **For Players**: Enjoy instant Erratic seed finding!
2. **For Modders**: Customize the filter for your needs
3. **For Researchers**: Analyze more glitched seeds

Happy seed hunting! ðŸŽ°
